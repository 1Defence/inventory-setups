# Inventory Setups
Save gear setups for specific activities.

### Creating a New Setup

To start, turn on the plugin and click on the equipment panel icon on the sidebar.

To create a new setup, click on the green plus button in the top right. It will prompt for a name, and then will take your current inventory and equipment and create a new setup.

You can view the setup by clicking on the eye icon, and you can go back to the overview panel by clicking on the back arrow in the top right.

### Highlighting

There are highlighting options for each setup. They are represented by the four buttons on the left side of the setup panel. To turn on highlighting, click on the button that looks like a highlighter. You can also change the highlight color with the next button over. Highlighting will cause slots to change color if an item in the player's inventory or equipment doesn't match the corresponding slot in the setup being viewed.

There are also options to change when highlighting will occur. The first option is stack difference. Enabling this will cause a slot to become highlighted if the item in the player's inventory or equipment does match the corresponding slot in the setup being viewed, but the stack size doesn't match. The second option is variation difference. Enabling this will cause a slot to become highlighted if the item in the player's inventory or equipment doesn't match the corresponding slot in the setup being viewed, even if it is very close. An example of this are rings of dueling. By default, a ring of dueling(8) will be considered the same as a ring of dueling(1). Enabling the variation difference will make them distinct for the purposes of highlighting.

### Exporting and Importing Setups

It is possible to import and export inventory setups. This is useful if you would like to share your setups with your friends. To export an inventory setup, click on the export button next to the view setup button. This will copy the setup to your clipboard. You can then send this to your friends.

To import a setup, click on the green import button in the top right. It will prompt for a setup. Paste the setup and confirm. The new setup will be added to the bottom of the list of setups.
